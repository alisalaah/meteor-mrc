# Meteor Relay Chat (MRC)

Meteor Relay Chat (MRC) is a Meteor chat implementation modeled after IRC.  This is a complete solution and is customizable but not intended as an embedded solution in to an existing site.

# Installation

1. `meteor add alisalaah:mrc`
2. Add `{{> mrc}}` within your body tags
3. Add your desired login services `meteor add accounts-ui accounts-facebook`

* Note: MRC is intended for a blank Meteor application

# Example

Demo: http://mrc.meteor.com

* Note: The code for the demo is inside this github under the `demo` folder.

# Usage

MRC is highly configurable through built in settings.  Default settings make it ready to go but pre-deployment settings can be set via your projects JavaScript or declare some custom templates or styling as well.

This project is still in development and more will be written when it is made available.
